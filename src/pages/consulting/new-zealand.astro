  {
    question: "What exactly does an AI Consultant do for my NZ business?",
    answer: "An AI consultant analyzes your current business operations to identify bottlenecks, repetitive tasks, and inefficiencies that can be solved with Artificial Intelligence. At SystemPros, we don't just advise; we build. We look at your customer support, sales pipelines, and data entry processes, then design and deploy custom AI agents (Voice, Chat, or Process Automation) to handle these tasks. For a New Zealand business, this often means replacing expensive outsourced call centers or freeing up local staff from low-value admin work so they can focus on growth."
  },
  {
    question: "Is AI expensive to implement for a small Kiwi business?",
    answer: "Contrary to popular belief, AI is a deflationary technology. While there is an upfront investment for strategy and setup, the ongoing operational costs are a fraction of human labor. For example, a SystemPros Voice AI agent costs roughly $0.20 per hour of conversation, compared to the NZ Minimum Wage of over $23/hour. Our consulting services are tiered, making enterprise-grade automation accessible to SMEs in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch."
  },
  {
    question: "Will AI replace my current employees?",
    answer: "AI replaces tasks, not necessarily people. Our goal is to remove the 'robotic' work from your human staff. Data entry, appointment reminders, invoice chasing, and basic triage should be automated. This allows your Kiwi team to focus on high-value interactions, complex problem solving, and relationship building—work that actually drives revenue. Most of our clients find their staff are happier when relieved of the drudgery of repetitive admin."
  },
  {
    question: "How secure is my business data with AI?",
    answer: "Security is our primary directive. We utilize enterprise-grade encryption and strictly adhere to New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 principles. We do not train public models on your private data. All SystemPros implementations can be ring-fenced, ensuring your customer lists, financial data, and proprietary processes remain strictly confidential. We offer on-premise solutions for highly sensitive industries like healthcare and finance."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you serve businesses outside of Auckland?",
    answer: "Absolutely. SystemPros operates fully remotely across New Zealand. We have active implementations in Wellington, Christchurch, Hamilton, Tauranga, and Dunedin. AI infrastructure is cloud-based, meaning we can deploy and update your digital workforce instantly, regardless of your physical headquarters. Our consultation process is conducted via video conference, and we offer on-site workshops for larger enterprise integrations."
  },
  {
    question: "What industries do you specialize in?",
    answer: "We have deep expertise in service-based industries where client communication and scheduling are critical. This includes Trades (Plumbing, Roofing, Electrical), Healthcare (Dental, Chiropractic, GPs), Professional Services (Legal, Accounting, Real Estate), and Aged Care. Any business that relies on the phone ringing or appointments being booked is a prime candidate for our automation."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does an AI implementation take?",
    answer: "A standard deployment usually takes 2-4 weeks. Week 1 is the 'Forensic Audit' where we map your processes. Week 2 is 'Build & Train' where we configure the agents. Week 3 is 'Testing & Refinement', and Week 4 is 'Go Live'. Complex enterprise integrations with legacy CRM systems may take longer, but our rapid deployment protocols are designed to get you ROI within the first month."
  },
  {
    question: "Does the AI sound robotic?",
    answer: "No. We use the latest conversational voice models that are indistinguishable from humans in standard contexts. Our 'Kiwi' models understand local slang, intonation, and geography. They pause, say 'um', and can handle interruptions naturally. Your customers often won't realize they are speaking to a machine until the booking confirmation arrives instantly in their inbox."
  },
  {
    question: "Can the AI integrate with Xero?",
    answer: "Yes, Xero integration is one of our most requested features for NZ businesses. Our AI agents can generate invoices, chase up overdue accounts, reconcile payments, and update client details directly in Xero. We also integrate with Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, and clinically specific software like Cliniko or Gensolve."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the ROI on AI Consulting?",
    answer: "Our clients typically see a 30-50% reduction in operational overheads within 6 months. By automating the 'first mile' of customer interaction (answering calls, qualifying leads), you stop missing opportunities. If your AI agent captures just one high-value lead that would have otherwise gone to voicemail, the system often pays for itself for the entire year."
